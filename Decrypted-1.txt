EXTREMELY. USED TO MODIFY ADJECTIVES DESCRIBING A LEVEL OR QUALITY OF
DIFFICULTY; THE CONNOTATION IS OFTEN `MORE SO THAN IT SHOULD BE' THIS
IS GENERALIZED FROM THE COMPUTER-SCIENCE TERMS `NP-HARD' AND
`NP-COMPLETE'; NP-COMPLETE PROBLEMS ALL SEEM TO BE VERY HARD, BUT SO
FAR NO ONE HAS FOUND A PROOF THAT THEY ARE. NP IS THE SET OF
NONDETERMINISTIC-POLYNOMIAL ALGORITHMS, THOSE THAT CAN BE COMPLETED BY
A NONDETERMINISTIC TURING MACHINE IN AN AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IS A
POLYNOMIAL FUNCTION OF THE SIZE OF THE INPUT; A SOLUTION FOR ONE
NP-COMPLETE PROBLEM WOULD SOLVE ALL THE OTHERS. "CODING A BITBLT
IMPLEMENTATION TO PERFORM CORRECTLY IN EVERY CASE IS NP-ANNOYING."

NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT STRICTLY SPEAKING THIS USAGE IS MISLEADING; THERE
ARE PLENTY OF EASY PROBLEMS IN CLASS NP. NP-COMPLETE PROBLEMS ARE HARD
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE IN CLASS NP, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE HARDEST
PROBLEMS IN CLASS NP.

THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY TRAWLING PROGRAM SOMETIMES ASSUMED TO BE
READING THE NET FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S SPOOKS. MOST HACKERS USED TO
THINK IT WAS MYTHICAL BUT BELIEVED IN ACTING AS THOUGH EXISTED JUST IN
CASE. SINCE THE MID-1990S IT HAS GRADUALLY BECOME KNOWN THAT THE NSA
ACTUALLY DOES THIS, QUITE ILLEGALY, THROUGH ITS ECHELON PROGRAM.

THE STANDARD COUNTERMEASURE IS TO PUT LOADED PHRASES LIKE `KGB',
`UZI', `NUCLEAR MATERIALS', `PALESTINE', `COCAINE', AND
`ASSASSINATION' IN THEIR [9540]SIG BLOCKS IN A (PROBABLY FUTILE)
ATTEMPT TO CONFUSE AND OVERLOAD THE CREATURE. THE [9541]GNU VERSION OF
[9542]EMACS ACTUALLY HAS A COMMAND THAT RANDOMLY INSERTS A BUNCH OF
INSIDIOUS ANARCHO-VERBIAGE INTO YOUR EDITED TEXT.

AS FAR BACK AS THE 1970S THERE WAS A MAINSTREAM VARIANT OF THIS MYTH
INVOLVING A `TRUNK LINE MONITOR', WHICH SUPPOSEDLY USED SPEECH
RECOGNITION TO EXTRACT WORDS FROM TELEPHONE TRUNKS. THIS IS MUCH
HARDER THAN NOTICING KEYWORDS IN EMAIL, AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO
ORIGINALLY PROPAGATED IT HAD NO IDEA OF THEN-CURRENT TECHNOLOGY OR THE
STORAGE, SIGNAL-PROCESSING, OR SPEECH RECOGNITION NEEDS OF SUCH A
PROJECT. ON THE BASIS OF MASS-STORAGE COSTS ALONE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
CHEAPER TO HIRE 50 HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS AND JUST LET THEM LISTEN IN.
TWENTY YEARS AND SEVERAL ORDERS OF TECHNOLOGICAL MAGNITUDE LATER,
HOWEVER, THERE ARE CLEAR INDICATIONS THAT THE NSA HAS ACTUALLY
DEPLOYED SUCH FILTERING (AGAIN, VERY MUCH AGAINST U.S. LAW).

IT IS FREQUENTLY OBSERVED THAT THE INCENTIVES THAT WOULD BE OFFERED

JOB AT THE MOST; WHAT'S TAKING THEM SO LONG?"

AT IBM, FOLKLORE DIVIDES THE WORLD INTO ONE-, TWO-, AND THREE-BANANA
PROBLEMS. OTHER CULTURES HAVE DIFFERENT HIERARCHIES AND MAY DIVIDE
THEM MORE FINELY; AT ICL, FOR EXAMPLE, FIVE GRAPES (A BUNCH) EQUALS A
BANANA. THEIR UPPER LIMIT FOR THE IN-HOUSE [9726]SYSAPES IS SAID TO BE
TWO BANANAS AND THREE GRAPES (ANOTHER SOURCE CLAIMS IT'S THREE BANANAS

ONE-LINER WARS N.

A GAME POPULAR AMONG HACKERS WHO CODE IN THE LANGUAGE APL (SEE
[9735]WRITE-ONLY LANGUAGE AND [9736]LINE NOISE). THE OBJECTIVE IS TO
SEE WHO CAN CODE THE MOST INTERESTING AND/OR USEFUL ROUTINE IN ONE
LINE OF OPERATORS CHOSEN FROM APL'S EXCEEDINGLY [9737]HAIRY PRIMITIVE
SET. A SIMILAR AMUSEMENT WAS PRACTICED AMONG [9738]TECO HACKERS AND IS
NOW POPULAR AMONG [9739]PERL AFICIONADOS.

KEN IVERSON, THE INVENTOR OF APL, HAS BEEN CREDITED WITH A ONE-LINER
THAT, GIVEN A NUMBER N, PRODUCES A LIST OF THE PRIME NUMBERS FROM 1 TO
N INCLUSIVE. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS:

(2 = 0 +.= T O.| T) / T <- IN

WHERE `O' IS THE APL NULL CHARACTER, THE ASSIGNMENT ARROW IS A SINGLE
CHARACTER, AND `I' REPRESENTS THE APL IOTA.

HERE'S A [9740]PERL PROGRAM THAT PRINTS PRIMES:
PERL -WLE '(1 X $_) !~ /^(11+)\1+$/ && PRINT WHILE ++ $_'

IN THE PERL WORLD THIS GAME IS SOMETIMES CALLED PERL GOLF BECAUSE THE
PLAYER WITH THE FEWEST (KEY)STROKES WINS.

[FROM THE DR. SEUSS TITLE "BARTHOLOMEW AND THE OOBLECK"; THE SPELLING
`OOBLECK' IS STILL CURRENT IN THE MAINSTREAM] A BIZARRE SEMI-LIQUID
SLUDGE MADE FROM CORNSTARCH AND WATER. ENJOYED AMONG HACKERS WHO MAKE
BATCHES DURING PLAYTIME AT PARTIES FOR ITS AMUSING AND EXTREMELY
NON-NEWTONIAN BEHAVIOR; IT POURS AND SPLATTERS, BUT RESISTS RAPID
MOTION LIKE A SOLID AND WILL EVEN CRACK WHEN HIT BY A HAMMER. OFTEN
FOUND NEAR LASERS.

HERE IS A FIELD-TESTED OOBLICK RECIPE CONTRIBUTED BY GLS:

1 CUP CORNSTARCH
1 CUP BAKING SODA
3/4 CUP WATER
N DROPS OF FOOD COLORING

THIS RECIPE ISN'T QUITE AS NON-NEWTONIAN AS A PURE CORNSTARCH OOBLICK,
BUT HAS AN APPROPRIATELY SLIMY FEEL.

SOME, HOWEVER, INSIST THAT THE NOTION OF AN OOBLICK RECIPE IS FAR TOO
MECHANICAL, AND THAT IT IS BEST TO ADD THE WATER IN SMALL INCREMENTS
SO THAT THE VARIOUS MIXED STATES THE CORNSTARCH GOES THROUGH AS IT
BECOMES OOBLICK CAN BE GROKKED IN FULLNESS BY MANY HANDS. FOR OPTIONAL
INGREDIENTS OF THIS EXPERIENCE, SEE THE "[9744]CEREMONIAL CHEMICALS"

ALL PROGRAMMERS ARE OPTIMISTS. PERHAPS THIS MODERN SORCERY
ESPECIALLY ATTRACTS THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN HAPPY ENDINGS AND FAIRY
GODMOTHERS. PERHAPS THE HUNDREDS OF NITTY FRUSTRATIONS DRIVE AWAY
ALL BUT THOSE WHO HABITUALLY FOCUS ON THE END GOAL. PERHAPS IT IS
MERELY THAT COMPUTERS ARE YOUNG, PROGRAMMERS ARE YOUNGER, AND THE
YOUNG ARE ALWAYS OPTIMISTS. BUT HOWEVER THE SELECTION PROCESS
WORKS, THE RESULT IS INDISPUTABLE: "THIS TIME IT WILL SURELY RUN,"
OR "I JUST FOUND THE LAST BUG.".

PASCAL N.

AN ALGOL-DESCENDED LANGUAGE DESIGNED BY NIKLAUS WIRTH ON THE CDC 6600
AROUND 1967-68 AS AN INSTRUCTIONAL TOOL FOR ELEMENTARY PROGRAMMING.
THIS LANGUAGE, DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO KEEP STUDENTS FROM SHOOTING
THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT AND THUS EXTREMELY RESTRICTIVE FROM A
GENERAL-PURPOSE-PROGRAMMING POINT OF VIEW, WAS LATER PROMOTED AS A
GENERAL-PURPOSE TOOL AND, IN FACT, BECAME THE ANCESTOR OF A LARGE
FAMILY OF LANGUAGES INCLUDING MODULA-2 AND [10111]ADA (SEE ALSO
[10112]BONDAGE-AND-DISCIPLINE LANGUAGE). THE HACKISH POINT OF VIEW ON
PASCAL WAS PROBABLY BEST SUMMED UP BY A DEVASTATING (AND, IN ITS
DEADPAN WAY, SCREAMINGLY FUNNY) 1981 PAPER BY BRIAN KERNIGHAN (OF
[10113]K&R FAME) ENTITLED "WHY PASCAL IS NOT MY FAVORITE PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGE", WHICH WAS TURNED DOWN BY THE TECHNICAL JOURNALS BUT
CIRCULATED WIDELY VIA PHOTOCOPIES. IT WAS EVENTUALLY PUBLISHED IN
"COMPARING AND ASSESSING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES", EDITED BY ALAN FEUER
AND NARAIN GEHANI (PRENTICE-HALL, 1984). PART OF HIS DISCUSSION IS
WORTH REPEATING HERE, BECAUSE ITS CRITICISMS ARE STILL APPOSITE TO
PASCAL ITSELF AFTER TEN YEARS OF IMPROVEMENT AND COULD ALSO STAND AS
AN INDICTMENT OF MANY OTHER BONDAGE-AND-DISCIPLINE LANGUAGES. AT THE
END OF A SUMMARY OF THE CASE AGAINST PASCAL, KERNIGHAN WROTE:

9. THERE IS NO ESCAPE

THIS LAST POINT IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT. THE LANGUAGE IS
INADEQUATE BUT CIRCUMSCRIBED, BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY TO ESCAPE ITS
LIMITATIONS. THERE ARE NO CASTS TO DISABLE THE TYPE-CHECKING WHEN
NECESSARY. THERE IS NO WAY TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE RUN-TIME
ENVIRONMENT WITH A SENSIBLE ONE, UNLESS ONE CONTROLS THE COMPILER
THAT DEFINES THE "STANDARD PROCEDURES". THE LANGUAGE IS CLOSED.

PEOPLE WHO USE PASCAL FOR SERIOUS PROGRAMMING FALL INTO A FATAL
TRAP. BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE IS IMPOTENT, IT MUST BE EXTENDED. BUT
EACH GROUP EXTENDS PASCAL IN ITS OWN DIRECTION, TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE WHATEVER LANGUAGE THEY REALLY WANT. EXTENSIONS FOR SEPARATE
COMPILATION, FORTRAN-LIKE COMMON, STRING DATA TYPES, INTERNAL
STATIC VARIABLES, INITIALIZATION, OCTAL NUMBERS, BIT OPERATORS,
ETC., ALL ADD TO THE UTILITY OF THE LANGUAGE FOR ONE GROUP BUT
DESTROY ITS PORTABILITY TO OTHERS.

I FEEL THAT IT IS A MISTAKE TO USE PASCAL FOR ANYTHING MUCH BEYOND
ITS ORIGINAL TARGET. IN ITS PURE FORM, PASCAL IS A TOY LANGUAGE,
SUITABLE FOR TEACHING BUT NOT FOR REAL PROGRAMMING.

PASCAL HAS SINCE BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY DISPLACED (BY [10114]C) FROM THE
NICHES IT HAD ACQUIRED IN SERIOUS APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEMS
PROGRAMMING, BUT RETAINS SOME POPULARITY AS A HOBBYIST LANGUAGE IN THE
MS-DOS AND MACINTOSH WORLDS.

AND EXAMINE BEFORE INSTALLING). THEY COULDN'T FIND ANY [10130]TRAP
DOORS OR ANY WAY TO PENETRATE SECURITY OF IBM'S OS, SO THEY MADE A
SITE VISIT TO AN IBM OFFICE (REMEMBER, THESE WERE OFFICIAL MILITARY
TYPES WHO WERE PURPORTEDLY ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS), SWIPED SOME IBM
STATIONERY, AND CREATED A FAKE PATCH. THE PATCH WAS ACTUALLY THE
TRAPDOOR THEY NEEDED. THE PATCH WAS DISTRIBUTED AT ABOUT THE RIGHT
TIME FOR AN IBM PATCH, HAD OFFICIAL STATIONERY AND ALL ACCOMPANYING

PHASE

1. N. THE OFFSET OF ONE'S WAKING-SLEEPING SCHEDULE WITH RESPECT TO THE
STANDARD 24-HOUR CYCLE; A USEFUL CONCEPT AMONG PEOPLE WHO OFTEN WORK
AT NIGHT AND/OR ACCORDING TO NO FIXED SCHEDULE. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO
CHANGE ONE'S PHASE BY AS MUCH AS 6 HOURS PER DAY ON A REGULAR BASIS.
"WHAT'S YOUR PHASE?" "I'VE BEEN GETTING IN ABOUT 8 P.M. LATELY, BUT
I'M GOING TO [10293]WRAP AROUND TO THE DAY SCHEDULE BY FRIDAY." A
PERSON WHO IS ROUGHLY 12 HOURS OUT OF PHASE IS SOMETIMES SAID TO BE IN
`NIGHT MODE'. (THE TERM `DAY MODE' IS ALSO (BUT LESS FREQUENTLY) USED,
MEANING YOU'RE WORKING 9 TO 5 (OR, MORE LIKELY, 10 TO 6).) THE ACT OF
ALTERING ONE'S CYCLE IS CALLED `CHANGING PHASE'; `PHASE SHIFTING' HAS
ALSO BEEN RECENTLY REPORTED FROM CALTECH. 2. `CHANGE PHASE THE HARD
WAY': TO STAY AWAKE FOR A VERY LONG TIME IN ORDER TO GET INTO A
DIFFERENT PHASE. 3. `CHANGE PHASE THE EASY WAY': TO STAY ASLEEP, ETC.
HOWEVER, SOME CLAIM THAT EITHER STAYING AWAKE LONGER OR SLEEPING
LONGER IS EASY, AND THAT IT IS SHORTENING YOUR DAY OR NIGHT THAT IS
REALLY HARD (SEE [10294]WRAP AROUND). THE `JET LAG' THAT AFFLICTS
TRAVELERS WHO CROSS MANY TIME-ZONE BOUNDARIES MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO TWO
DISTINCT CAUSES: THE STRAIN OF TRAVEL PER SE, AND THE STRAIN OF
CHANGING PHASE. HACKERS WHO SUDDENLY FIND THAT THEY MUST CHANGE PHASE
DRASTICALLY IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, PARTICULARLY THE HARD WAY,
EXPERIENCE SOMETHING VERY LIKE JET LAG WITHOUT TRAVELING.

TRUE STORY: ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A PROGRAM BUG THAT REALLY DID
DEPEND ON THE PHASE OF THE MOON. THERE WAS A LITTLE SUBROUTINE THAT
HAD TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS AT MIT TO CALCULATE AN
APPROXIMATION TO THE MOON'S TRUE PHASE. GLS INCORPORATED THIS ROUTINE
INTO A LISP PROGRAM THAT, WHEN IT WROTE OUT A FILE, WOULD PRINT A
TIMESTAMP LINE ALMOST 80 CHARACTERS LONG. VERY OCCASIONALLY THE FIRST
LINE OF THE MESSAGE WOULD BE TOO LONG AND WOULD OVERFLOW ONTO THE NEXT
LINE, AND WHEN THE FILE WAS LATER READ BACK IN THE PROGRAM WOULD
[10299]BARF. THE LENGTH OF THE FIRST LINE DEPENDED ON BOTH THE PRECISE
DATE AND TIME AND THE LENGTH OF THE PHASE SPECIFICATION WHEN THE
TIMESTAMP WAS PRINTED, AND SO THE BUG LITERALLY DEPENDED ON THE PHASE
OF THE MOON!

THE FIRST PAPER EDITION OF THE JARGON FILE (STEELE-1983) INCLUDED AN
EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE TIMESTAMP LINES THAT EXHIBITED THIS BUG, BUT THE
TYPESETTER `CORRECTED' IT. THIS HAS SINCE BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE
PHASE-OF-THE-MOON-BUG BUG.

HOWEVER, BEWARE OF ASSUMPTIONS. A FEW YEARS AGO, ENGINEERS OF CERN
(EUROPEAN CENTER FOR NUCLEAR RESEARCH) WERE BAFFLED BY SOME ERRORS IN
EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED WITH THE LEP PARTICLE ACCELERATOR. AS THE
FORMIDABLE AMOUNT OF DATA GENERATED BY SUCH DEVICES IS HEAVILY
PROCESSED BY COMPUTERS BEFORE BEING SEEN BY HUMANS, MANY PEOPLE
SUGGESTED THE SOFTWARE WAS SOMEHOW SENSITIVE TO THE PHASE OF THE MOON.
A FEW DESPERATE ENGINEERS DISCOVERED THE TRUTH; THE ERROR TURNED OUT
TO BE THE RESULT OF A TINY CHANGE IN THE GEOMETRY OF THE 27KM
CIRCUMFERENCE RING, PHYSICALLY CAUSED BY THE DEFORMATION OF THE EARTH
BY THE PASSAGE OF THE MOON! THIS STORY HAS ENTERED PHYSICS FOLKLORE AS
A NEWTONIAN VENGEANCE ON PARTICLE PHYSICS AND AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE
RELEVANCE OF THE SIMPLEST AND OLDEST PHYSICAL LAWS TO THE MOST MODERN
SCIENCE.

[FROM `PHONE PHREAK'] 1. THE ART AND SCIENCE OF [10318]CRACKING THE

2. BY EXTENSION, SECURITY-CRACKING IN ANY OTHER CONTEXT (ESPECIALLY,
BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, ON COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS) (SEE
[10319]CRACKING).

AT ONE TIME PHREAKING WAS A SEMI-RESPECTABLE ACTIVITY AMONG HACKERS;
THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT THAT PHREAKING AS AN INTELLECTUAL
GAME AND A FORM OF EXPLORATION WAS OK, BUT SERIOUS THEFT OF SERVICES
WAS TABOO. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT CROSSOVER BETWEEN THE HACKER
COMMUNITY AND THE HARD-CORE PHONE PHREAKS WHO RAN SEMI-UNDERGROUND
NETWORKS OF THEIR OWN THROUGH SUCH MEDIA AS THE LEGENDARY "TAP
NEWSLETTER". THIS ETHOS BEGAN TO BREAK DOWN IN THE MID-1980S AS WIDER
DISSEMINATION OF THE TECHNIQUES PUT THEM IN THE HANDS OF LESS
RESPONSIBLE PHREAKS. AROUND THE SAME TIME, CHANGES IN THE PHONE
NETWORK MADE OLD-STYLE TECHNICAL INGENUITY LESS EFFECTIVE AS A WAY OF
HACKING IT, SO PHREAKING CAME TO DEPEND MORE ON OVERTLY CRIMINAL ACTS
SUCH AS STEALING PHONE-CARD NUMBERS. THE CRIMES AND PUNISHMENTS OF
GANGS LIKE THE `414 GROUP' TURNED THAT GAME VERY UGLY. A FEW OLD-TIME
HACKERS STILL PHREAK CASUALLY JUST TO KEEP THEIR HAND IN, BUT MOST
THESE DAYS HAVE HARDLY EVEN HEARD OF `BLUE BOXES' OR ANY OF THE OTHER
PARAPHERNALIA OF THE GREAT PHREAKS OF YORE.
