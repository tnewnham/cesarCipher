          HEAVY RAIN NOW FALLS.
                         
          GATSBY, DRESSED IN WHITE FLANNEL SUIT, SILVER SHIRT, AND GOLD
          TIE, LEADS A DOZEN UMBRELLA-HOLDING SERVANTS ACROSS THE LAWN.
          HERZOG HOLDS AN UMBRELLA OVER GATSBY; THE OTHER SERVANTS
          SHELTER EXTRAVAGANT FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS IN CRYSTAL VASES...
                         
          NICK WATCHES THE PARADE THROUGH HIS WINDOW, OPENING HIS DOOR
          JUST AS GATSBY ARRIVES; THE SERVANTS CONTINUE INSIDE.
                         
          ON THE PORCH, GATSBY LOOKS AROUND DISTRACTEDLY.

                    ONE OF THE PAPERS SAID THEY THOUGHT
                    THE RAIN WOULD STOP ABOUT FOUR. I
                    THINK IT WAS THE JOURNAL...
                         
          AN AWKWARD BEAT.

          FRONT, AND TURNS TO NICK, FLUSHED WITH FRESH PANIC.

          THE REUNITED LOVERS STAND, STARING AT EACH OTHER FOR A LONG,

          FROZEN ON THE EDGE OF A CHAIR.
                         
          THE RATTLE OF THE TEA TRAY AS NICK ENTERS ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO
          THE ALREADY UNBEARABLE TENSION. GATSBY MANAGES TO MURMUR.

          NICK AND DAISY FOLLOW GATSBY INTO THE BEDROOM...
                                                                  68.
                         
                         
          GATSBY BOUNDS AHEAD, STARTING UP A SPIRAL STAIR... HE THROWS
          OPEN A MASSIVE CABINET, REVEALING A PRISM OF SUITS, DRESSING-
          GOWNS, WATCHES AND TIES.
                         
                                             GATSBY
                    I'VE GOT A MAN IN ENGLAND WHO BUYS
                    ME CLOTHES...!
                         
          HE PLAYFULLY TOSSES DAISY A BOATER-HAT...
                         
                                             GATSBY (CONT'D)
                    SOMETHING FOR THE LADY...
                         
          THEN HE BEGINS YANKING DOWN SHIRTS AND TOSSING THEM OVER THE
          RAIL TO DAISY...
                         
                                             DAISY

                    HE SENDS OVER A SELECTION AT THE
                    BEGINNING OF EACH SEASON...

                    NICKY! HE'S A MADMAN!
                         
          MORE AND MORE AND MORE SHIRTS FLOAT DOWN...
                         
          THE RUMBLE OF DISTANT THUNDER.
                         
          CLOSE ON: DAISY. TIME SLOWS AS SHIRTS FLUTTER, LIKE GIANT
          SNOWFLAKES, DOWN TOWARD HER. SLOWLY, QUIETLY, HER MIRTH
          TRANSFORMS TO SOBS... SHE HIDES HER FACE IN SHIRTS...
                         
          GATSBY EASES DOWN THE STAIRS AND NESTLES BESIDE DAISY, TAKING
          HER TEAR-STREAKED FACE IN HIS HANDS...
                         
                                             GATSBY
                    WHAT IS IT?
                                                                  69.
                         
                         
                                              DAISY
                    IT'S JUST... IT MAKES ME SAD,
                    BECAUSE...
                         
          DAISY GLANCES IN NICK'S DIRECTION...
                         
                                             GATSBY
                    WHY?
                         
                                             DAISY
                    ...BECAUSE...
                         
          A SUSPENDED MOMENT; DAISY IS INCAPABLE OF SPEAKING HER HEART.
                         
                              NICK (V.O.)
                    FIVE LOST YEARS STRUGGLED ON
                    DAISY'S LIPS. BUT ALL SHE COULD
                    MANAGE WAS...
                         
                                             DAISY
                    IT'S JUST... BECAUSE I'VE NEVER
                    SEEN SUCH BEAUTIFUL SHIRTS BEFORE.
                         
                                             GATSBY
                    IF IT WASN'T FOR THE MIST WE COULD
                    SEE THE GREEN LIGHT...
                         
                                             DAISY
                    WHAT GREEN LIGHT?
                         
                                             GATSBY
                    THE ONE THAT BURNS ALL NIGHT AT THE
                    END OF YOUR DOCK.
                         
          AS GATSBY AND DAISY STARE OUT ACROSS THE BAY...
                         
                              NICK (V.O.)
                    POSSIBLY, IT HAD OCCURRED TO GATSBY
                    THAT THE COLOSSAL SIGNIFICANCE OF
                    THAT LIGHT HAD VANISHED FOREVER.
                    NOW, IT WAS ONCE AGAIN JUST A GREEN
                    LIGHT ON A DOCK. HIS COUNT OF
                    ENCHANTED OBJECTS HAD DIMINISHED BY
                    ONE.
                         
          NICK, IMPELLED TO REMIND DAISY AND GATSBY OF HIS PRESENCE,
          EMERGES FROM THE SHADOWS AND DESCENDS THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE.
                         
          HE HOLDS A PHOTO OF AN ELDERLY MAN IN YACHTING COSTUME...
                         
                                             NICK
                    WHO'S THIS? YOUR FATHER?
                                                                    70.

                    NO, NO.. THAT'S MR. DAN CODY, OLD
                    SPORT... HE'S DEAD NOW. HE USED TO
                    BE MY BEST FRIEND YEARS AGO.
                         
          DAISY JOINS NICK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS. IN THE PHOTO
          WITH CODY, ALSO IN YACHTING COSTUME, IS A YOUNG GATSBY...
                         
                                             DAISY
                                       (TEASES)
                    YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOU HAD A
                    POMPADOUR... OR A YACHT.
                         
          GATSBY HASTILY PLUCKS A SCRAPBOOK FROM A ROW ON HIS DESK...
                         
                                              GATSBY
                    I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING...
                    LOOK, HERE'S A LOT OF CLIPPINGS,
                    ABOUT YOU.
                         
          THEY ADMIRE A SCRAPBOOK TOGETHER.

                    YOU SAVED MY LETTERS...
                         
                                             GATSBY
                    THIS WAS MY FIRST PHOTO OF YOU.
                         
          AS DAISY FLIPS THROUGH AND PULLS OUT AN OLD LETTER OF HERS,
          WE HEAR HER READING THE LETTER IN ABSTRACT VOICEOVER:
                         
                              DAISY (V.O.)
                    WE CANT LOSE EACH OTHER AND LET ALL
                    THIS GLORIOUS LOVE END IN NOTHING.
                    COME HOME, I'LL BE HERE WAITING AND
                    HOPING, FOR EVERY LONG DREAM OF YOU
                    TO COME TRUE... COME HOME JAY...

                    EXCUSE ME.
                         
          GATSBY CROSSES THE ROOM, SNATCHES UP THE RECEIVER, AND TURNS
          AWAY... HE LOWERS HIS VOICE.
                         
                              GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D)
                    WELL I CAN'T TALK NOW OLD SPORT...
                         
          AS THE TIMBRE OF GATSBY'S VOICE DARKENS WE PUSH CLOSER.
                         
                              GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D)
                     I SAID A SMALL TOWN.

                       HE MUST KNOW WHAT A SMALL TOWN IS.
                         
          BOOOOMMM! A STORMING WIND BANGS OPEN THE FRENCH WINDOWS!
                         
          AS NICK MOVES TO SHUT THEM, HE GLIMPSES GATSBY...

                       IS HIS IDEA OF A SMALL TOWN...
                         
          GATSBY RINGS OFF ABRUPTLY, AND CATCHES NICK'S EYE - A TENSE
          MOMENT - WHICH GATSBY BANISHES WITH THAT ELECTRIFYING SMILE.
                         
          WE HEAR THE DISTANT, JAUNTY SOUNDS OF A PIPE ORGAN...
                         
                                                GATSBY (CONT'D)
                       AH, KLIPSPRINGER! HE MUST BE AWAKE!
                       SHALL WE?
                         
                         
          INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - DUSK BECOMING NIGHT
                         
          DAISY, WEARING A FLOWING ROBE AND HEELS, DANCES A CHARLESTON
          WITH NICK.
                         
          AN ELABORATE PICNIC, COMPLETE WITH CANDELABRAS AND A MOUNTAIN
          OF CUSHIONS, IS LAID OUT ON THE FLOOR. THERE, GATSBY SITS,
          LOOKING ON, FLUSH WITH JOY.
