For this midterm you will be performing an analysis on a document that has been converted using a Caesar Cypher.

To do this you will do the following:

Word Count of the document
Character Count of the document
Comparison to the expected frequencies of characters in the English Language
Use a natural language processing library to compare samples of the words within your document to see if they are valid english words
Find the correct decryption of the document and save the output file.
Please write a report illustrating your experiments. You need to explain your basic idea about how to design the computing algorithm. 
You may add comments to the source code such that the source code can be read and understood by the graders.

In the report, you should include the answers to the following questions.

1) Explanation of the source code:

What are the functions of your lambda functions?
Which kind of intermediate results are generated?
2) Experimental Results

Screenshots of the key steps. For example, the screenshot for the outputs in the terminal when you run the command.
It will demonstrate that your program has no bug.
2.2) Explain your results. Does your implementation give the exact Caesar Cypher values?

Submission Materials:

a) Your report

b) Source code (link to .py/.scala file in GitHub or BitBucket)

c) The outputs in the terminal (Intermediate results)

d) The output file of your program (Decrypted document values using the .saveAsTextFile command )

e) The name of the source each file came from
